# Hi there 👋

## Who am I?
I am a **Full-Stack AI Engineer** with a strong interest in **Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security**.  
I am passionate about building systems that **simplify human work, increase efficiency, and enable autonomous or semi-autonomous workflows** through AI-driven solutions.  
My focus is on developing **security-aware LLM-based systems** and deploying them reliably into production environments.

## Cyber Security Background
- Security log analysis and technical interpretation  
- Threat detection and investigation using EDR solutions  
- Process tree analysis (suspicious process behavior and execution chains)  
- Technical analysis and reporting of security incidents  
- Fundamental penetration testing knowledge (web, system, and basic attack vectors)  
- Strong networking knowledge (TCP/IP, DNS, routing, firewalls, segmentation)  
- Developing AI and backend systems with a security-first mindset

## What I am currently working on
- LLM-based applications  
- **Security-focused MCPs (Model Context Protocol)**  
- Computer Vision solutions  
- AI-integrated, security-aware backend systems

## Software & Full-Stack
- **Backend:** Django  
- API development  
- Security-oriented backend implementations  
- Git & GitHub

## Technology Stack (Summary)
- AI / ML, LLMs, RAG, MCP  
- Computer Vision  
- Cyber Security, EDR, pentesting basics, networking  
- Django, APIs  
- Docker, MLOps  
- Git & GitHub
